<center><p><h2><mark>The Accuracy International AWM </mark>(Arctic Warfare Magnum or AI-Arctic Warfare Magnum) is a bolt-action sniper rifle manufactured by Accuracy International designed for magnum rifle cartridges. The Accuracy International AWM is also unofficially known as the AWSM (Arctic Warfare Super Magnum), which typically denotes AWM rifles chambered in .338 Lapua MagnumThe AWM rifle is normally supplied in a metal transit case together with a telescopic sight, mount, butt spacers, bipod, spare magazines, sling, cleaning and tool kits..
Normally, the AWMs are outfitted with a Schmidt & Bender PM II 10?2/MILITARY MK II 10?2 telescopic sight with 10?fixed power of magnification. However, a Schmidt & Bender PM II/MILITARY MK II with variable magnification of either 3?2?0, 4?6?0 or 5?5?6 can be used if the operator wants more flexibility to shoot at varying ranges, or when a wide field of view is required. Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the German made Schmidt & Bender PM II/MILITARY MK II product line as sighting components on their rifles, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer. The German and Russian Army preferred a telescopic sight made by Zeiss[2] over Accuracy International's preference.On 09 September 2012, Accuracy International announced that the .338 Lapua Magnum AWM rifle was phased out and replaced by the Accuracy International AXMC sniper rifle.</h2></p></center>
